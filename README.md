## Course Overview

This course is designed to teach you the core concepts of Java SE 17 programming, including:

- **Basic Syntax**: Variables, data types, operators, and control flow.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Exception Handling**: Try-catch blocks, custom exceptions, and best practices.
- **Collections Framework**: Lists, sets, maps, and other data structures.
- **Streams API**: Functional programming with streams, filters, and lambda expressions.
- **Concurrency**: Threads, synchronization, and parallelism.
- **Modules and Packages**: Understanding Java's module system introduced in Java 9.
- **Advanced Topics**: Annotations, reflection, and working with files and I/O.

By the end of this course, you'll have a solid understanding of Java SE 17 and be able to build robust, maintainable applications.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

- **Basic Computer Skills**: Familiarity with using a computer and navigating the file system.
- **Text Editor or IDE**: We recommend using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code for writing and running Java code.
- **JDK 17 Installed**: You need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 installed on your machine. You can download it from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific topic. Each module includes:

- **Lecture Notes**: Detailed explanations of key concepts.
- **Code Examples**: Practical examples demonstrating how to implement the concepts.
- **Exercises**: Hands-on coding challenges to reinforce learning.
- **Projects**: Larger projects that integrate multiple concepts and allow you to apply what you've learned.
